Going Further: Although GitHub is the most popular service that hosts “git” repositories, it is not the only such site. BitBucketa offers a similar set of features to GitHub, though it has a different pricing model (you get unlimited free private repos, but are limited in the number of collaborators). GitLabb offers a hosting system that incorporates more operations and deployment services for software projects.
